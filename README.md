# TurboMiner - Optimized Next Generation Ethereum Miner

Designed from the ground up to maximize mining profitability.
TurboMiner contains a super optimized mining kernel to bring maximum possible hash rates to miners.<br />
Next generation features like "Stale Share Reduction" reduce stale shares to less than 1% to maximize mining income.<br />

Half the development fees of competing miners with higher returns.

TurboMiner gives you full control over your GPU cards for overclocking and fan / temperature control and provides important feedback on hash rates and power usage to allow you to tune for an optimal performance (Average watts per hash etc.)

<h3>Features</h3>
- Supports Ethereum and Ethereum classic<br />
- OpenCL AMD, NVidia compatible<br />
- Extremely stable miner<br />
- Optimized for AMD GPUs<br />
- High hash rates<br />
- Stale Share Reduction technology<br />
- Temperature / Fan control<br />
- Overclocking support<br />
- Stratum protocol support<br />
- Feedback on temperature and power usage, watts per hash etc.<br />
- Current exchange rate information<br />
- Low CPU usage<br />
- Highly configurable mining options per card<br />
- Automatic Lockup Detection<br />
- Simple installation<br />
- Small footprint<br \>

Available now: TurboMiner Linux 16.04 64bit<br />
Coming soon: TurboMiner for Windows<br />

<h3>Installation instructions</h3>
Download the latest release here: https://github.com/TurboMiner/TurboMiner/releases/ <br />
Unzip it on your miner!

<h3>Usage</h3>
Ensure you have the latest AMDGPU-PRO Driver for Linux installed (at time of writing 17.50) or a similar OpenCL display driver for your (NVidia) video card / APU.

For best results, always start TurboMiner with root privileges eg. sudo ./turbominer this will allow displaying of GPU specific data and allow overclocking control.

To do a quick test just run TurboMiner out of the box, alternatively you can modify the settings.dat file to mine on your own specific account / server.

<h3>Notes</h3>
TurboMiner will give you extremely low stale share rates, it is however advised to use a standard (good quality) wired internet connection - running on a busy Wifi connection will not bring you the desired results, whatever miner you use.

Your feedback is important to us, if you have an issue let us know and we can fix it.

Development of TurboMiner is continuing, a lot of experimental features have been disabled for this release. First up is the Windows release though. Let us know if you have feature requests, just post an issue with it.
