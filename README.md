# TurboMiner - Optimized Next Generation Ethereum Miner

TurboMiner is designed from the ground up to maximize mining profitability.

It contains a super optimized mining kernel to bring you the maximum possible hash rates.<br />
Combine this with next generation features like "Stale Share Reduction" which reduce stale shares to an incredible less than 1%.<br />
Utilizing an extremely stable mining controller with "Automatic Lockup Detection", it keeps running even in the event a GPU locks up.

TurboMiner gives you full control of your GPU card for overclocking and fan / temperature control and provides important feedback on hash rates and power usage to allow you to tune for an optimal performance (Average watts per hash etc.)
