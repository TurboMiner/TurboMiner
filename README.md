# TurboMiner - Optimized Next Generation Ethereum Miner

TurboMiner is designed from the ground up to maximize mining profitability.

It contains a super optimized mining kernel to bring you the maximum possible hash rates.
Combine this with next generation features like "Stale Share Reduction" which reduce stale shares to an incredible less than 1%.
Utilizing an extremely stable mining controller with "Automatic Lockup Detection", it keeps running even in the event a GPU locks up.

TurboMiner gives you full control of your GPU card for overclocking and fan / temperature control and provides important feedback on hash rates and power usage to allow you to tune for an optimal performance (Average watts per hash etc.)
